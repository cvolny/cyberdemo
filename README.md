# Hello WebAuthn!

This is a demonstration of integrating webauthn API into a Django website. I'm utilizing django-mfa2 for the technical implementation of FIDO2 (see their FIDO2.py) as a dependency in order to create a drop in django module to replace user/password authentication with user/webauthn (+registration token) authentication.
